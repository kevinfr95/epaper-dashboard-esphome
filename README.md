## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

The provided ESPHome YAML contains **anonymized sensor values** (e.g., temperature sensors, text sensors, calendar, EV status).  
üëâ **You must replace those `sensor:` and `text_sensor:` `entity_id`s** with the ones matching your own Home Assistant setup.

Example:

```yaml
# Replace this...
entity_id: sensor.temp_room1

# With your real sensor, e.g.:
entity_id: sensor.living_room_temperature
